Find the most frequently curring quantity in Geoffrey's box and return the highest index of the partition with that quantity.<br>
        Note: <ul>
    <li><b> The partitions are 0 indexed.</b></li>
    <li><b> If two or more quantities have the same frequency, then consider the highest quantity among them</b></li>
    </ul>
